<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h3>Version:1.0</h3>
<p>This is an Angular 2 application.</p>
<p>It based on Quikstart seed from official Angular 2 site.</p>
<p>And it uses Spotify Web API to search artists and display their albums and tracks.</p>
<br/>
<p>I have implemented this app to demo most importent Angular 2 concepts such as:</p>
<p>1. Multiple Components</p>
<p>2. Services</p>
<p>3. Routing</p>
<p>4. HTTP communication with external REST API</p>
